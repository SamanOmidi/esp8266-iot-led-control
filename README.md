# ESP8266 IoT LED Control

This project was developed as part of an IoT course during my Bachelor’s degree.

An ESP8266 connects to the internet and controls an onboard LED based on commands received from:
- A Django-based web application
- A Telegram bot

The ESP8266 communicates with the backend over HTTP and toggles the LED ON/OFF accordingly.

## Technologies
- ESP8266 (Arduino/C)
- Django (Python)
- Telegram Bot API
- HTTP communication
